# **Lab: File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass**

>  This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.  
>  The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.  
>  To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

Giờ đổi tên file name. Dùng đường dẫn tuyệt đối để truy xuất file `/etc/passwd`:

```
filename=/etc/passwd
```

Done~~~
